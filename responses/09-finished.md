_Congratulations!_ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

You finished the course. You can now make a basic JSON server using Express and NodeJS! You're kind of like a wizard! ðŸ§™ But you have only scratched the surface.

To learn more about Express, visit the official [website](https://expressjs.com/).
There are a lot of other applications for NodeJ.js as well. Check out their [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) for more info.

Now go make something! ðŸš€
