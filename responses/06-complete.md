Good Job! ðŸš€ Postman can be a really helpful testing tool as you continue your programming journey.

Before closing out this course, try a few more things in Postman:

- [ ] Change the password value in the body tab to see what an incorrect password response looks like
- [ ] Try our earlier requests that we made from the browser (remember to switch to GET in Postman)
- [ ] See if you can make a new endpoint in the server.js code, then call it from Postman
